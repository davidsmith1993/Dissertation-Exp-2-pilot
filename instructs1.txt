WELCOME TO THIS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT

I've divided a number of images into two categories (category A and B).
Your task is to learn, by trial-and-error, which images belong in each category.
When you first start, you'll be guessing, but over time you should try to
improve, and increase your accuracy.

The images look like sewer gratings and the width and/or angle of the grates 
will vary from trial to trial. On each trial, you will see one image.
