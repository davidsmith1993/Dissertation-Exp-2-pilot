Recall, your task is to learn, by trial-and-error, which images belong in each category.
When you first start, you'll be guessing, but over time you should try to
improve and increase your accuracy. Your goal is to be as accurate as possible. 
In fact, it is possible to be correct on every trial. To help you gauge your 
performance, at the end of each block (4 total) you will be told how accurate you were 
(i.e., your percent correct). Your goal is to increase your accuracy to 100% correct.




The experimenter will review the instructions and answer any questions 
you may have. Please do not hesitate to ask questions - these 
instructions are complicated and questions are expected.
