Experiment began =  2018  9  24  15  24  12 
Experiment duration (minutes) = 42.558 

POSITION VARIABLES:
Assumed distance between subject and monitor = 558.800000 

STIMULUS VARIABLES:
Stimulus: gratings varying in spatial frequency (arbitrary) and angle (arbitrary). 
     Converted to cycles/degree (ultimately cycles/image) and degrees from horizontal. 
Orientation scaling factors:
 20.00
  0.90
orientation scaling: scaled_or = data.o_gain(1)+data.o_gain(2)*arbitrary_or; Visual angle = 5.000000 
Spatial frequency scaling factors:
  0.25
  0.02
spatial frequency scaling: scaled_sf = data.sf_gain(1)+data.sf_gain(2)*arbitrary_sf; 
RESPONSE VARIABLES:
If the category-keyboard mapping = 1 (i.e., using right hand), n=catA, j=catB
If the category-keyboard mapping = 2 (i.e., using left hand), v=catA, f=catB
Category-keyboard mapping = 1 n=catA, j=catB
