Congratulations! You've completed training. 

Now we want to see if the knowledge you gained will help you on another task.

On each trial, you will be presented with both components of the stimulus (i.e, both line angle 
and circle diameter and asked one question:
Is this image a member of category A or category B? 

Use the training you just completed to help you make the correct choice.

Unlike training, you will not receive any feedback unless you take longer than 60 s to respond.
